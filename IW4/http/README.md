# HTTP Get 
This scripts allow the client iw4x servers to send http request. The gsc will handle generate requests and read the response generated from the python scripts. 

## Usage
Download the files from the git and put `_http.gsc` into `userraw\scripts` then copy the `handleRequests.py` and put it into `userraw` folder. 
Not that `handleRequests.py` can be put in any folders as long as you change the `SERVER_FOLDERS_LOCATION` to the rigth path
