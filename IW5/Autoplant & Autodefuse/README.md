# Autoplant & Autodefuse
Developed by DoktorSAS

This mod was made for S&R servers. Although it works correctly they 
decided not to use this code but to recreate it in their own way. 

The script simply forces players into the team that triggers the bomb and at the correct 
time defuses the bomb or places it automatically. This script doesn't have much use 
outside the trickshotting world.
